/**
 * Flow state enumeration
 *
 * Indicates the state in the flow table of a flow entry.  These are
 * only valid when the entry's ID is valid (not INDIGO_FLOW_ID_INVALID).
 *
 * Due to the async nature of flow table modifications, we maintain
 * these states for each flow.  Note that if a flow is deleted while
 * an operation is outstanding for that flow, we must queue the operation
 * until it has completed.  If a delete operation occurs on a flow, we
 * ignore further operations on that flow, wait for any pending operation
 * to complete and then remove any other queued operations.
 *
 * There are still some corner cases; for example, if a queued operation
 * would have failed, but a later delete operation occurs, no error
 * message will be generated for the op that would have failed.
 *
 * States:
 *
 * FREE => Not in use.
 * NEW => Allocated but not committed; call is being made to fwding
 * CREATED => Flow is stable, successfully added to forwarding, nothing pending
 * MODIFYING => Modify request is pending with forwarding, but entry
 * should be counted as active.
 * DELETE_MARKED => Flow is marked for deletion; other modify calls pending
 * DELETING => Request to delete the entry has been made to forwarding

         that of the last successful modify request

/***** MATCHING *****/

/**
 * Flow table queries
 *
 * Since matching is based on properties of an entry, these declarations
 * are here in ft_entry
 *
 * There are two types of flow table queries:
 *
 * (1) Match a packet:  match packet fields to the entry's match structure;
 * (2) Query for a set of flow entries:  Use meta-match criteria including
 * the entry's match structure as well as cookies, priority or time since added.
 *
 * For core, the first is only needed for the "table" action on packet out,
 * and possibly not even then.  We do not currently optimize for this case.
 *
 * For the second, we can use "flow space" to describe the relationship.
 * This is described more fully elsewhere.  In short: Given a match, M,
 * let FS(M) be the subset of flow space that is determined by the match.
 *
 * The OpenFlow spec refers to a "strict match".  Given a query match, Mq,
 * the strict match is a match, M, (whose priority must be specified and) such
 * that FS(M) == FS(Mq).
 *
 * For a query match, Mq, the "non-strict match" is the set of entries for
 * which each M in the set satisfies FS(M) is a subset of FS(Mq).
 *
 * For queries, the called routine will allocate the the variable length
 * list of flow IDs and the caller is responsible freeing it.
